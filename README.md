# Python
Project Clock:
I’m excited to share my latest project—a sleek and functional Digital Clock built using Python! This project leverages Python’s tkinter library to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. 
Why This Project?
This digital clock project is a great example of how Python can be used to build practical, everyday applications. It combines fundamental programming concepts with real-world usability, demonstrating how coding skills can be applied to create useful tools.

Project dice:
This Python script simulates the rolling of one or more dice, providing a simple and effective way to generate random outcomes. It can be used for games, probability experiments, or just for fun. The script allows you to specify the number of dice and the number of sides on each die, making it highly customizable for various scenarios.
