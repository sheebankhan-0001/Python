(1). Project Clock:
I’m excited to share my latest project—a sleek and functional Digital Clock built using Python! This project leverages Python’s tkinter library to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. 
Why This Project?
This digital clock project is a great example of how Python can be used to build practical, everyday applications. It combines fundamental programming concepts with real-world usability, demonstrating how coding skills can be applied to create useful tools.

(2). Project dice:
This Python script simulates the rolling of one or more dice, providing a simple and effective way to generate random outcomes. It can be used for games, probability experiments, or just for fun. The script allows you to specify the number of dice and the number of sides on each die, making it highly customizable for various scenarios.


(3). Project Contact Book:
A Contact Book in Python is a simple console-based project where users can manage contacts by adding, updating, viewing, searching, deleting, and counting entries.
Key Features:
 (1)Create Contact: Add new contact entries with details like name, phone number, email, etc.
 (2)Update Contact: Modify the details of an existing contact.
 (3)View Contacts: Display all contacts in the contact book.
 (4)Search Contact: Search for a contact by name or phone number.
 (5)Delete Contact: Remove an existing contact from the contact book.
 (6)Count Contacts: Display the total number of contacts in the contact book.


 (4). Projec To-Do Task App:
Objective:
Develop a simple command-line To-Do Task App using Python that allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently. The app will enable users to add tasks, update them, delete tasks, and view all tasks for the day.
Features:
(1)Add Tasks:
Users can create new tasks by providing a task description.
Each task will be stored with a unique task ID and its creation timestamp.
(2)View Tasks:
Users can view all tasks in a list format, displaying each task's ID, description, and status (e.g., pending or completed).
Option to view tasks either sorted by creation time or by task status.
(3)Update Tasks:
Users can update task descriptions if there are any changes.
Users can also mark tasks as completed once finished.
(4)Delete Tasks:
Users can delete a task from the list using its unique ID
